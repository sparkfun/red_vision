# This example demonstrates a basic vision processing pipeline. A pipeline is
# just a sequence of steps used to extract meaningful data from an image. The
# pipeline in this example attempts to detect the SparkFun flame logo using
# contour matching. If it's detected, it will be outlined on the display for
# visualization. The bounding box and center of the logo will also be drawn,
# demonstrating how to acquire useful numerical data from an image (eg. the
# position and size of an object).
#
# Note that this pipeline is very simple and does not include many of the steps
# that would typically be included in more robust pipelines. This was done for
# simplicity and performance, so it may produce false positives or miss the logo
# entirely sometimes.

# created manually by picking points on the boundary of a small image of the
# logo in an image editor. Below is also ASCII art of the logo for reference,
