# This example demonstrates near-minimal code to get started with OpenCV in
# MicroPython. It can be used to verify that OpenCV is working correctly, and
# that the display driver is functioning. It simpy imports the required modules,
# creates a blank image, draws some things on it, and shows it on the display.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Import OpenCV, just as you would in any other Python environment!
import cv2 as cv

# Standard OpenCV leverages the host operating system to access hardware, but we
# don't have that luxury in MicroPython. Instead, drivers are provided for
# various hardware components, which need to be initialized before using them.
# The examples import a module called `cv2_hardware_init`, which initializes the
# drivers. You may need to edit the contents of the `cv2_hardware_init` module
# based on your specific board and hardware configuration
from rv_init import display

# Import NumPy, almost like any other Python environment! The only difference is
# the addition of `from ulab` since MicroPython does not have a full NumPy
# implementation; ulab NumPy is a lightweight version of standard NumPy
from ulab import numpy as np

# Initialize an image (NumPy array) to be displayed, just like in any other
# Python environment! Here we create a 240x320 pixel image with 3 color channels
# (BGR order, like standard OpenCV) and a data type of `uint8` (you should
# always specify the data type, because NumPy defaults to `float`)
img = np.zeros((240, 320, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

# Images can be accessed and modified directly if desired with array slicing.
# Here we set the top 50 rows of the image to blue (remember, BGR order!)
img[0:50, :] = (255, 0, 0)

# OpenCV's drawing functions can be used to modify the image as well. For
# example, we can draw a green ellipse at the center of the image
img = cv.ellipse(img, (160, 120), (100, 50), 0, 0, 360, (0, 255, 0), -1)

# Note - Most OpenCV functions return the resulting image. It's redundant for
# the drawing functions and often ignored, but if you call those functions from
# the REPL without assigning it to a variable, the entire array will be printed.
# To avoid this, you can simply re-assign the image variable (for example,
# `img = cv.function(...)`)

# And the obligatory "Hello OpenCV" text! This time in red
img = cv.putText(img, "Hello OpenCV!", (50, 200), cv.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 0, 255), 2)

# Once we have an image ready to show, just call `cv.imshow()`, almost like any
# other Python environment! However, there is one important difference:
# 
# Standard OpenCV takes a window name string in `cv.imshow()`, which is used
# to display the image in a window. We don't have windows in MicroPython, so
# there is an API change where the first argument must be a display driver. Any
# display driver can be used, as long as it implements an `imshow()` method that
# takes a NumPy array as input
cv.imshow(display, img) # Can alternatively call `display.imshow(img)`

# Standard OpenCV requires a call to `cv.waitKey()` to process events and
# actually display the image. However, the display driver shows the image
# immediately, so it's not necessary to call `cv.waitKey()` in MicroPython.
# But it is available, and behaves almost like any other Python environment! The
# only difference is that it requires a key to be pressed in the REPL instead of
# a window. It will wait for up to the specified number of milliseconds (0 for
# indefinite), and return the ASCII code of the key pressed (-1 if no key press)
# 
# Note - Some MicroPython IDEs (like Thonny) don't actually send any key presses
# until you hit Enter on your keyboard
print("Press any key to continue")
key = cv.waitKey(0) # Not necessary to display image, can remove if desired

# Print the key pressed
print("Key pressed:", chr(key))

# Normally at the end of OpenCV scripts, you would call `cv.destroyAllWindows()`
# to close all OpenCV windows. That function doesn't exist in the MicroPython
# port of OpenCV, but you can instead call `display.clear()` to set the display
# to a blank state, or `display.splash()` to show the splash screen
display.clear() # Can instead call `display.splash()` with optional filename
