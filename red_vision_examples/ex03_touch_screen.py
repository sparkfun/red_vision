# 
# This example demonstrates how to read input from a touch screen, which can be
# used to verify that the touch screen driver is functioning. It simply draws
# lines on a blank image based on touch input, similar to a drawing application.

# Import OpenCV and hardware initialization module
import cv2 as cv
from rv_init import display, touch_screen

# Import NumPy
from ulab import numpy as np

# Initialize an image to draw on
img = np.zeros((240, 320, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

# Prompt the user to draw on the screen

# Prompt the user to press a key to continue
print("Press any key to continue")

            # This is the first touch, set both (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) to the
            # initial touch coordinates. This will draw a point at the touch
            # location if no further touch inputs are made
